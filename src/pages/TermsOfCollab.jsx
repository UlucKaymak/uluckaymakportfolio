            - All commissioned work is defined by the brief mutually agreed upon before the project begins.<br />

            - Base rate: $75 (unless otherwise negotiated) <br />
            - Upfront: 50% payment required before project begins ((for first-time clients) don't take this
            personal)) <br />
            - Final: Remaining 50% due upon delivery <br />
            - Consulting rate: $10/hour for advisory or brainstorming sessions <br />
            - All payments should be made via bank transfer, Stripe, BuyMeACoffee, or Crypto. <br />

          <h3>Revisions</h3>
          <p>
            - Projects include up to 3 revision rounds. <br />
            - Further changes beyond that will be charged additionally. <br />
            - If revisions deviate significantly from the original brief, a new budget may be proposed.
          </p>

          <h3>Delivery</h3>
          <p>
            - Delivery format (audio/video/code/image) is specified per project. <br />
            - Source files (if included) will be sent after full payment. <br />
            - Final files are shared via a downloadable link or a shared folder (WeTransfer, Drive, etc.).

          <h3>Cancellation</h3>
          <p>
            - If the project is canceled after starting, the upfront payment is non-refundable. <br />
            - If I cancel due to scheduling or health, a refund will be provided if no work has begun.
          </p>

          <h3>Personal Note</h3>
          <p>
            - I'm here to make meaningful and unique work. Let's respect each other's time, labor, and weird
            ideas.
