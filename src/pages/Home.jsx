          <p>A person who loves learning and creating new things.</p>
          <p>
            I am a multidisciplinary artist who combines conceptual art with the pieces of the
            culture I was born and raised in figurative points in audio and/or visual, interactive and
            algorithmic forms. My projects often shape around themes such as human perception, experience,
            and psychology.
          </p>
          <p>
            On my personal projects, I work on fractured emotions and thoughts through various
            forms of digital projection, focusing on interactive audio-visual experience.
